This is simple app that creates a .py file that when clicked in file explorer will open a URL designated. I made this to simplifiy the steps
in making a shortcut on your desktop to a specific web address. All you need to do is copy paste a url into the terminal when the program is running
and a new .py file is generated. You can the double clik, or run as .py file and the web page should open. It is currently set to google chrome because that
is the browser I like to use.
